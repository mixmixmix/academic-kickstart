## Courses:
I helped to design and deliver [Python beginners course](https://github.com/ChasNelson1990/python-zero-to-hero-beginners-course) for Royal Society of Biology. It is available as a self-tough resource and was well received on multiple occasions. Check it out.

For Royal Microscopical Society, I taught a one-day Machine Learning workshop which now is being converted into a stand-alone course in my repository [Learnmachine](https://github.com/mixmixmix/learnmachine). It contains lectures and exercises in Python for beginners and refreshers alike.
